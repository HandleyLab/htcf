What is the use of .bashrc file?

Bash is a shell, a command processor that typically runs in a text window where the user types commands that cause actions.
The .bashrc file is a script file that is executed whenever a new terminal session is started in **interactive mode**. On HTCF this is executed for your login shell and the shells you enter after running srun or salloc commands. This file contains commands to set up the shell for use in your particular environment.
You can use it to set environment variables, define aliases, and define functions.
