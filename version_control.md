git and GitHub can be daunting at first, but a few commands are all you need to get started.

If you're new to version control and wondering why this is important, [this is a nice overview](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004668).

## Version control your code with git
1. Start by [downloading git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) on your local machine.
2. Read [documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs) or find a tutorial (there are many good ones) to understand what each command is doing and test them out locally.
```
git init
git status
git add
git commit
```

## Sharing your code on GitHub
2. Learn these when you're ready to put something on GitHub.
