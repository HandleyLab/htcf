git and GitHub can be daunting at first, but a few commands are all you need to get started.

If you're new to version control and wondering why this is important, [this is a nice overview](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004668).


1. Start here - Read [documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs) or find a tutorial (there are many good ones) to understand what each command is doing and test them out locally.
Prerequisites: [download git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) on your local machine
```
git init
git status
git add
git commit
```


2. Learn these when you're ready to put something on GitHub.
Prerequisites: GitHub account associated with a wustl email, dbaldridge-lab member with write access, set up

```
