git and GitHub can be daunting at first, but a few commands are all you need to get started. Sections are listed in order of importance; get comfortable with the information under one heading before moving on to the next. 

If you're new to version control and wondering why this is important, [this is a nice overview](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004668).

2. Open a terminal
3. Set your username: `git config --global user.name "FIRST_NAME LAST_NAME"`
4. Set your email address: `git config --global user.email "my_wustl_key@wustl.edu"`
5. Read [documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs) or find a tutorial to understand the following commands.
```
git init

git commit
```
