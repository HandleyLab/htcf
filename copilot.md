# GitHub Copilot and Copilot Chat

WashU employees can request GitHub Copilot Enterprise accounts for any users with a wustl email in your GitHub organization.

There is no process to bill labs for this service, though that could change in the future. The full cost is $45/month/user.

1. If you need to create a GitHub organization or move it under the WashU Enterprise GitHub umbrella, you will need to submit a ticket to RIS:
[https://washu.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portals](https://washu.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portals)
- select Research Infrastructure Services (RIS)
- select "Research Applications and Services" then "Request Provisioning or Migration of GitHub Organization" and fill out the form

2. Request that Copilot Enterprise be enabled for your GitHub organization.
3. Request that through "Request a Configuration Change or Upgrade to an Application". Or, if you open a ticket to move or create a GitHub organization, simply respond to that. 
4. Give access to lab members. Employees must have GitHub accounts that are added as members of the lab's GitHub organization. Select which accounts will have copilot enabled by [following these instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/copilot/managing-github-copilot-in-your-organization/granting-access-to-copilot-for-members-of-your-organization
