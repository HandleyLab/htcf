[Review Storage Types on HTCF](https://htcf.wustl.edu/docs/storage/)
- Backup raw and processed data files to LTS. 
- After processing, delete large intermediate files that can be re-generated.
- Retain log files in the same folder as the finalized results.
- Add README to raw data folder containing link to relevant Lab Archives pages.
